#Pymaceuticals


•	The pharmaceutical company, Pymaceuticals.inc recently began screening for potential treatment for squamous cell carcinoma. IN hits project the complete data from their most recent study is analyzed in Jupyter Notebook. MatPlotLib  and pandas libraries are used for data visualization. In this study, 249 mice who were identified with SCC tumors received treatment with a range of drug regimens. The time period for the observation is 45 days. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticals’ drug of interest, Capomulin, against the other treatment regimens.

•	First step, to prepare the data , one mouse with duplicate entries was identified and removed from the project

•	A summary statistics table including of the mean, median, variance, standard deviation, and SEM of the tumor volume for each drug regimen

•	Two bar charts were generated using both Pandas's DataFrame.plot() and Matplotlib's pyplot that shows the number of time  points for all mice tested for each treatment regimen.

•	Two pie charts were created using both Pandas's DataFrame.plot() and Matplotlib's pyplot that shows the distribution of female or male mice in the study.

•	Calculated the final tumor volume of each mouse across four of the most promising treatment regimens: Capomulin, Ramicane, Infubinol, and Ceftamin.

•	Calculated the quartiles, IQR and potential outliers across all four treatment regimens.

•	A box and whisker plot created using MatPlotLib that shows shows the distribution of the final tumor volume for all the mice in each treatment group.

•	A line plot of time points versus tumor volume for a single mouse treated with Capomulin.

•	Generated a scatter plot of tumor volume versus mouse weight for the Capomulin treatment regimen.

•	A scatter plot of mouse weight versus average tumor volume for the Capomulin treatment regimen was generated

•	Calculated the correlation coefficient and linear regression model between mouse weight and average tumor volume for the Capomulin treatment. Plotted the linear regression model on top of the previous scatter plot.
